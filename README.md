# MicrostructureSims
Simulates microstructures to be analyzed for further scattering simulations


Currently only holds old data and programs from 2017. It is wildly inefficient, so the structure as well as its function needs to be updated.

### To Do:

* Cubic columnal grains with cross-like microstructure (2D and 3D)
* Spherical fine grains (2D and 3D)
* Efficiency and necessary computational power estimates
